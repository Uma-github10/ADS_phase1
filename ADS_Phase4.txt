What is Customer Segmentation?  

     •    Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several  
          groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to  
          marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.  
     •    The     technique        of    customer        segmentation          is   dependent          on    several      key  
          differentiators that divide customers into groups to be targeted. Data related to  
          demographics, geography, economic status as well as behavioral patterns play a  
          crucial role in determining the company direction towards addressing the various  
          segments.  

Dataset:  

The dataset is acquired from kaggle and the link is given below:  

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers     

The dataset consists of following five features of 200 customers:  

     •    Customer ID: Unique ID assigned to the customer  
     •    Gender: Gender of the customer  
     •    Age: Age of the customer  
     •    Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customer  
     •    Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior  
          and spending nature.

Visualizing the clusters:

Observations:  

     •   The age of the customers ranges from 18-70. This shows that the mall attracts  
         shops and things which suit all age group people.  
     •   The average age of customers is 39.  
     •   The average income of customers is 60 K$.  
     •   The average spending score of customers is 50.  
  

Conclusion:  

Using k-means clustering we have managed to form different clusters based on different  
features.  Mall  management  can  target  the  clusters  with  average  spending  score  to  
increase their profit and should also maintain good relationship with premium customers  
with high spending score. They should also work on coming up with new innovative ideas  
to upgrade the customers with low spending scores.
